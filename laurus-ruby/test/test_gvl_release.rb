# Prove that Index methods release the GVL (Global VM Lock) while doing
# Rust/tokio work (Issue #1103).
#
# Before this change, every `Index` method held the GVL for the whole
# duration of its `rt.block_on(...)` call. A background Ruby thread calling
# another `Index` method could not even *start* running until the
# foreground call returned, because acquiring the GVL is a prerequisite for
# making any Ruby call at all -- including entering another `Index` method.
#
# These tests use that fact directly: kick off a slow call on one thread,
# and from a second thread, call a quick `Index` method shortly after the
# slow one starts. If the GVL is genuinely released while the slow call's
# Rust/tokio work runs, the quick call can begin (and finish) *before* the
# slow one completes. If the GVL were held for the whole slow call, the
# quick call could not even begin until the slow call returns the GVL, so
# it would necessarily start after the slow call finishes.
#
# This mirrors the approach used for the Python binding's equivalent test
# (`laurus-python/tests/test_gil_release.py`): it measures actual
# interleaving of two genuine `Index` calls, which is a more reliable
# signal than inferring lock state from a background counter's progress.
