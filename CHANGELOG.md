## Unreleased

### Breaking Changes

- Doc-centric `VectorEngine` implementation replaces the old `VectorCollection` module. All related types, docs, samples, and resources now use the `VectorEngine*` naming to reflect the unified API.
- `VectorEngineQuery` has been renamed to `VectorEngineSearchRequest` so request/response types share a consistent naming scheme.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- `RawFieldPayload` has been renamed to `FieldPayload` to keep the doc-centric ingestion API aligned with `FieldVectors` terminology.
