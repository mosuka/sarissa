//! Vector index writer trait and common types.
//!
//! This module defines the `VectorIndexWriter` trait which all vector index writer
//! implementations must follow. The primary implementations are:
//! - `HnswIndexWriter` in the `hnsw` module for approximate nearest neighbor search
//! - `FlatIndexWriter` in the `flat` module for exact search
//! - `IvfIndexWriter` in the `ivf` module for memory-efficient search

/// This configuration contains settings that are common across all vector index writer
/// implementations (Flat, HNSW, IVF), similar to `InvertedIndexWriterConfig` in the lexical module.
///
/// Type-specific settings (dimension, distance metric, HNSW parameters, etc.) are defined
/// in the respective index configs: `FlatIndexConfig`, `HnswIndexConfig`, `IvfIndexConfig`.

/// Trait for vector index writers.
///
/// This trait defines the common interface that all vector index writer implementations
/// must follow. Writers are responsible for:
/// - Building vector indexes from collections of vectors
/// - Adding vectors incrementally during construction
/// - Finalizing index construction
/// - Writing indexes to persistent storage
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use sarissa::vector::index::hnsw::writer::HnswIndexWriter;
/// use sarissa::vector::index::config::HnswIndexConfig;
/// use sarissa::vector::writer::{VectorIndexWriter, VectorIndexWriterConfig};
/// use sarissa::storage::memory::{MemoryStorage, MemoryStorageConfig};
/// use sarissa::storage::StorageConfig;
/// use std::sync::Arc;
///
/// let storage = Arc::new(MemoryStorage::new(MemoryStorageConfig::default()));
/// let index_config = HnswIndexConfig::default();
/// let writer_config = VectorIndexWriterConfig::default();
/// let mut writer = HnswIndexWriter::with_storage(index_config, writer_config, storage).unwrap();
///
/// // Use VectorIndexWriter trait methods
/// // writer.add_vectors(vectors).unwrap();
/// // writer.finalize().unwrap();
/// // writer.write("my_index").unwrap();
