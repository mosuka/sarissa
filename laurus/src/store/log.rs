//! Unified document log combining WAL, doc_id generation, and document storage.
//!
//! [`DocumentLog`] provides a single component that:
//!
//! - Generates monotonically increasing document IDs
//! - Writes all operations to a durable append-only log (WAL)
//! - Stores documents in segmented files for retrieval
//! - Supports recovery by replaying the log
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! DocumentLog
//! ├── WAL (append-only log file)
//! │   └── All fields stored for recovery
//! └── Document Store (segmented files)
//!     └── Only stored fields kept for retrieval
//! ```
//!
//! ## File format
//!
//! The WAL log file stores a sequence of length-prefixed records. There are
//! three framings:
//!
//! - **v3** (current, #822): a 5-byte file header (`b"LWAL"` magic + version
//!   byte `3`), then `[u32 len][u32 crc32][rkyv payload]` per entry. Same CRC
//!   framing as v2, but each payload is a compact rkyv binary record instead of
//!   JSON — typically 3-5x smaller (vectors store as raw `f32`, not decimal
//!   strings) and faster to parse on recovery.
//! - **v2** (#815): a 5-byte header (`b"LWAL"` magic + version byte `2`), then
//!   `[u32 len][u32 crc32][json payload]` per entry. Still read for back-compat;
//!   never written by current code.
//! - **legacy** (pre-#542): no header, `[u32 len][json payload]` per entry, no
//!   checksum. Still read for back-compat.
//!
//! The CRC-32 (v2/v3) is computed over `len || payload`, so both a corrupted
//! length and a corrupted body are detected. A file keeps its framing for its
//! whole life; an older file that survives an upgrade is rewritten as v3 only on
//! the next commit/truncate, and the framings are never mixed within one file.
//!
//! Each entry is followed by `flush_and_sync()` for durability.
//!
//! ## Recovery
//!
//! [`DocumentLog::read_all`] replays the file and stops at the first record it
//! cannot read in full — a short length prefix, a short body, or a body that
//! fails to deserialize. Such a torn trailing record (e.g. from a crash
//! mid-append) is dropped along with everything after it, and the valid prefix
//! is recovered so the engine can still open. Recovery never skips a bad record
//! to continue, which keeps the recovered sequence gap-free and consistent.
