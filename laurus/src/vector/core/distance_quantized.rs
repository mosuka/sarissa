//! int8 SIMD distance kernel for per-segment global affine SQ.
//!
//! Companion to [`crate::vector::core::distance`] (the f32 path) and
//! [`crate::vector::core::quantization`] (the SQ encoder). After
//! Issue #481 Stage 1 the HNSW / Flat / IVF search hot path uses
//! the functions in this module instead of the f32 kernels.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! With per-segment global affine SQ, every f32 element is encoded
//! as `q = clamp(round((v - offset) / scale), 0, 255)`, sharing one
//! `(offset, scale)` pair across the whole segment. The dot product
//! reconstructs from the quantized form via the affine identity:
//!
//! ```text
//! a · b ≈ N·offset² + scale·offset·(Σaq + Σbq) + scale²·Σ(aq · bq)
//! ```
//!
//! Of those four terms only `Σ(aq · bq)` is per-pair: it is computed
//! in i32 SIMD using [`dot_u8_to_i32`]. The other three collapse into
//! constants once the candidate's `sum_q` is loaded — that constant
//! is what makes the int8 kernel fast vs the f32 kernel.
//!
//! For Euclidean and Manhattan, the `offset` cancels in `(a - b)`, so
//! distance computation reduces to a pure int8 difference accumulator
//! plus a single `scale²` (Euclidean) or `scale` (Manhattan) post-multiply.
//!
//! # SIMD strategy
//!
//! All accumulators use [`wide::i32x8`] (8-wide i32 lanes, portable
//! across x86_64 / aarch64 / wasm32 via the `wide` crate). Per-element
//! `u8 → i32` zero-extension happens at load time. `i32` is wide
//! enough to hold any per-pair product (`u8 * u8 ≤ 65025`) and the
//! per-chunk accumulation across realistic dimensions
//! (`dim ≤ 4096` keeps the running sum well below `i32::MAX`).
