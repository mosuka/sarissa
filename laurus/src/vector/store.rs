//! VectorStore: Simplified vector storage following LexicalStore pattern.
//!
//! This module provides a vector storage component with a simple 3-member structure:
//! - `index`: The underlying vector index
//! - `writer_cache`: Cached writer for write operations (`tokio::sync::Mutex`)
//! - `searcher_cache`: Cached searcher for search operations (`parking_lot::RwLock`)
//!
//! # Concurrency Strategy
//!
//! - **Searcher cache** uses double-checked locking with `RwLockWriteGuard::downgrade()`
//!   so that only searcher *creation* (on cache miss) holds an exclusive lock; the actual
//!   search executes under a shared read lock, allowing concurrent queries.
//! - **Writer cache** is protected by a `tokio::sync::Mutex`. Embedding (potentially slow
//!   network I/O) is performed *outside* the lock; only the final `delete + add_vectors`
//!   step runs while the lock is held, keeping the critical section short.
//!
//! # Module Structure
//!
//! - [`config`] - Configuration types (VectorIndexConfig, VectorFieldConfig)
//! - [`embedding_writer`] - Embedding writer wrapper
//! - [`request`] - Search request types
//! - [`response`] - Search response types
