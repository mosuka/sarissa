//! Segment manager for vector indexes.
//!
//! This module manages vector index segments, including segment metadata,
//! merging strategies, and segment lifecycle.
//!
//! The segment registry is persisted in a `segments.json` manifest. Since
//! #634 (PR-1 / #879) the manifest is **versioned, checksummed, and written
//! atomically** (temp file + CRC-32 trailer + fsync + rename — the same
//! #784/#786 standard the segment data files follow), so it can serve as
//! the commit pivot for the segment-per-commit pipeline: a crash mid-save
//! leaves the previous manifest intact, and a corrupted manifest fails the
//! open loudly instead of silently starting empty.
//!
//! Originally HNSW-only, this manager is shared across index types since
//! Issue #889 via [`SegmentFileLayout`] — the only piece of its behavior
//! that varies by on-disk file suffix.
