//! Shared merge-operation data types for vector index segments.
//!
//! [`MergeConfig`], [`MergeStats`], and [`MergeResult`] are index-type-
//! agnostic; each index type's own merge engine (e.g.
//! `hnsw::segment::merge_engine::MergeEngine`) performs the actual
//! type-specific segment-reader/segment-writer I/O and returns these shared
//! shapes.
