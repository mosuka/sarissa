//! On-disk format for the rerank sidecar (Issue #481 Stage 2).
//!
//! Stage 1 stored vectors as int8 only (LVS1 segment, see
//! [`super::format`]). Stage 2 adds an *optional* per-field sidecar
//! that carries the original full-precision vectors so the searcher
//! can do a wide candidate fetch over int8 (cheap) and then rescore
//! the top `top_k * rerank_factor` candidates against the original
//! values (accurate).
//!
//! The sidecar lives in a separate file (`*.<index_ext>.f32` for
//! [`crate::vector::core::rerank::RerankStorageKind::F32`]) and is
//! produced/consumed in lockstep with the LVS1 segment: vectors are
//! written in the same `(doc_id, field_name)` order as the matching
//! LVS1 segment so a (sidecar position) → (LVS1 position) mapping is
//! the identity. This keeps the sidecar self-contained — the LVS1
//! segment never references it.

//! New sidecars end with an 8-byte footer
//! `[RERANK_SIDECAR_FOOTER_MAGIC u32 LE][crc-32 u32 LE]` whose CRC-32
//! covers every preceding byte (header + payload), mirroring the
//! `.hnsw` footer added by Issue #786. Because the header fully
//! determines the content length, [`read_sidecar`] *detects* the footer
//! by the number of bytes remaining after the payload — footer
//! detection itself needs no file-size heuristics: zero remaining bytes
//! is a legacy footer-less sidecar (verification is skipped), exactly
//! eight is a footer (verified), anything else is corruption.
//!
//! Separately, the on-disk file size *is* used up front to bound the
//! payload allocation before the header is trusted (Issue #791); see
//! [`read_sidecar`]. That bound only caps how many bytes may be
//! allocated — it does not participate in the footer classification
//! above.
//!
//! # Backward compatibility
//!
//! Pre-Stage-2 segments do not have a sidecar file at all. Readers
//! must treat "sidecar file missing" as Stage 1 and fall back to the
//! int8 LVS1 path. This module never sees that case — it only knows
//! how to read a sidecar that exists.
//!
//! Sidecars written before Issue #788 lack the checksum footer and
//! still load (the footer is optional on read). Conversely, readers
//! that predate the footer stop at the payload end and never see the
//! trailing bytes, so new files remain readable by old code; the
//! header version stays at 1.
//!
//! One consequence of the optional footer: a footer-carrying sidecar
//! whose trailing 8 bytes are lost is byte-identical to a legacy file
//! and loads with verification skipped (the payload itself is still
//! bit-exact in that case — only the integrity guarantee is
//! downgraded). Partial footer loss (1–7 trailing bytes) is detected.
//! The same limitation applies to the `.hnsw` footer from Issue #786;
//! atomic temp+rename writes (Issue #784) make such tail loss
//! improbable in practice.
