//! Allocation bounds for on-disk vector segment parsing (Issue #806).
//!
//! Generalizes the Issue #791 technique. A vector segment reader/loader
//! takes element counts and byte lengths straight from an on-disk header
//! that has **not** yet been integrity-checked. The `.hnsw` CRC footer
//! (Issue #786) is verified before the reader's structural parse, but
//! *legacy footer-less segments* — and every writer load path, which does
//! not run the footer verification at all — reach these counts unverified.
//! A single flipped byte can turn a small `num_vectors` / `node_count` /
//! `field_name_len` into a multi-GiB allocation request that aborts the
//! process through `handle_alloc_error` (OOM) instead of surfacing a clean
//! "corrupted segment" error.
//!
//! These helpers reject impossible sizes up front by comparing the
//! header-declared size against ground truth: the true byte length of the
//! file, obtained from [`crate::storage::StorageInput::size`]. Because the
//! bytes a count or buffer describes must physically exist in the file, any
//! size larger than the bytes left in the relevant section is provably
//! corruption and is rejected before a single byte is allocated.
//!
//! Loaders capture `file_size = input.size()?` once and pass the bytes
//! still available (`file_size - stream_position`) as `available`; per-record
//! checks reuse the section's starting `available` so no extra `seek` /
//! `stream_position` syscall is added inside the hot per-record loops.

/// `available` bytes can hold at most `available / min_stride` of them. A
/// `count` larger than that cannot be backed by real data and is treated as
/// corruption — preventing a `with_capacity(count)` that would request
/// gigabytes from a flipped byte and abort via `handle_alloc_error`.

/// * `count` - The element count parsed from the (unverified) header.
/// * `min_stride` - A lower bound on the on-disk byte size of one element.

///   occupy; `0` is treated as `1` so the division never traps.
/// * `available` - The number of bytes the file can still supply for these
///   elements (typically `file_size - current_position`).
