//! IVF-specific segment file layout and merge engine.
//!
//! The generic segment manifest/manager, merge policies, reader cache, and
//! fan-out search layer shared across index types live in
//! [`crate::vector::index::segment`] (Issue #889); this module keeps only
//! what is IVF-specific: the merge engine (its I/O is IVF-typed, and it
//! re-clusters the merged union rather than just concatenating) and this
//! index type's on-disk file layout descriptor.

pub mod merge_engine;

/// On-disk file-suffix layout for IVF segments: a primary `.ivf` file, no
/// sidecars (IVF has no rerank sidecar), staged through a `.ivf.tmp` temp
/// file.
