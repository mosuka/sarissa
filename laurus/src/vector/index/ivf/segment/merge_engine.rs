//! Merge engine for IVF vector index segments.
//!
//! This module handles the actual merging of segments. [`MergeConfig`],
//! [`MergeStats`], and [`MergeResult`] are the shared, index-type-agnostic
//! data shapes defined in [`crate::vector::index::segment::merge`]; this
//! engine's own logic (below) is IVF-typed.
//!
//! Unlike Flat/HNSW, an IVF segment's inverted-list structure is meaningless
//! across a merge — cluster ids are assigned independently per segment (each
//! trains its own centroids from adaptive K over its own buffer, Issue #889),
//! so there is no way to reconcile cluster `i` in one source with cluster `i`
//! in another. A merge therefore discards every source's inverted lists
//! entirely, reduces to a flat, deduplicated, deletion-filtered
//! `(doc_id, field, Vector)` list (same as Flat's merge), and re-clusters
//! that union from scratch through the ordinary
//! [`IvfIndexWriter`]/`add_vectors`/`finalize` pipeline. No special
//! "expected count" setter is needed: `finalize` -> `train_centroids`
//! already recomputes the effective cluster count as
//! `configured_n_clusters.min(vectors.len()).max(1)` (Issue #889 PR-5) from
//! whatever `index_config.n_clusters` the writer was constructed with, so
//! constructing it with the same schema-level config the segmented index
//! already uses is sufficient to re-derive the adaptive K for the merged
//! union's size — including the zero-vectors case (Issue #889 PR-6), which
//! trains zero clusters instead of erroring.
