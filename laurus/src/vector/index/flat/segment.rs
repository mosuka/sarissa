//! Flat-specific segment file layout and merge engine.
//!
//! The generic segment manifest/manager, merge policies, reader cache, and
//! fan-out search layer shared across index types live in
//! [`crate::vector::index::segment`] (Issue #889); this module keeps only
//! what is Flat-specific: the merge engine (its I/O is Flat-typed) and this
//! index type's on-disk file layout descriptor.

/// sidecars (Flat has no rerank sidecar), staged through a `.flat.tmp` temp
