    ///
    /// - **Unified query DSL** (via `query_dsl`): The query string is
    ///   parsed using [`UnifiedQueryParser`](self::query::UnifiedQueryParser)
    ///   to automatically extract lexical and/or vector components. This is
    ///   the recommended approach for external callers.
    /// - **Structured fields** (via `lexical_search_request` /
    ///   `vector_search_request`): Lower-level API for programmatic use.
    ///
    /// When `query_dsl` is set, it is parsed first, and the resulting
    /// lexical/vector components replace any explicitly set fields. The
    /// `fusion_algorithm`, `limit`, `offset`, and `filter_query` fields
    /// from the original request are preserved.
    ///
    /// After resolving the query source, the engine executes the
    /// appropriate search mode:
    ///
    /// - **Lexical only**: BM25-scored inverted index search.
    /// - **Vector only**: Nearest-neighbor vector search.
    /// - **Hybrid**: Both searches run and results are merged using the
    ///   configured `fusion_algorithm` (defaults to
    ///   [`RRF { k: 60.0 }`](FusionAlgorithm::RRF)).
    ///
    /// When a `filter_query` is present, it is evaluated first to determine
    /// the set of candidate documents. For lexical search, the filter is
    /// combined with the user query via a boolean `must` + `filter` clause.
    /// For vector search, the filter produces an `allowed_ids` list that
    /// restricts candidate scoring. If the filter matches zero documents,
    /// an empty result is returned immediately.
    ///
    /// When both lexical and vector search requests are present, both fetch
    /// limits are doubled (2x overfetch) to improve fusion quality.
    ///
    /// Results are paginated via `offset` and `limit` on the
