//! Atomic segment manifest for the lexical inverted index (#1021).
//!
//! `segments.json` is the single, atomically replaced record of the
//! committed segment set — the counterpart of the vector side's
//! `SegmentManager` manifest, built on the shared
//! [`storage::manifest`](crate::storage::manifest) helpers (CRC-verified,
//! written via temp + rename + directory sync).
//!
//! # Authority and the save-then-swap rule
//!
//! The in-memory copy (owned by
//! [`InvertedIndex`](super::InvertedIndex), shared with its writer) is a
//! mirror of the last **successfully persisted** manifest, never ahead of
//! it. Every mutation goes through [`publish_with`]: build a candidate
//! under the write guard, persist it, and only on success swap it into
//! memory. This deliberately deviates from the vector manager's
//! mutate-then-save: there, a failed save leaves memory ahead of disk,
//! which is survivable when every later save rewrites the full list — but
//! here a retried commit would find its pending state consumed, publish
//! nothing, and still advance the WAL checkpoint, after which a reopen
//! would neither replay nor discover the segments.
//!
//! The manifest lock is a **leaf**: nothing under its guard may construct
//! readers, list storage, or take the index's metadata lock. The guard is
//! intentionally held across the save so two racing mutators cannot
//! publish manifests out of order (the same argument as
//! `SegmentManager::save_state_locked`); this is safe only while no other
//! code path — `Debug` impls included — blocks on this lock.
