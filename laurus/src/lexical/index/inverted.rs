//! Inverted index implementation for full-text search.
//!
//! This module provides the core inverted index implementation:
//! - Core data structures (posting lists, term enumeration)
//! - Index creation and management
//! - Writer for building the index
//! - Reader for querying the index
//! - Searcher for executing searches
//! - Segment management and merging
//! - Index maintenance operations
//! - Query types for searching
