//! Lexical indexing module for building and maintaining lexical indexes.
//!
//! This module provides the [`LexicalIndex`] trait, an index factory, configuration,
//! the core inverted index implementation, and supporting data structures
//! (term dictionaries, posting lists, segments).
//!
//! # Module Structure
//!
//! - [`config`] - Index configuration (storage mode, analyzer, merge policy, etc.)
//! - [`factory`] - Index factory for creating and opening indexes
//! - [`inverted`] - Inverted index implementation (including segments and maintenance)
//! - [`structures`] - Low-level data structures (term dictionaries, posting lists, skip lists)
