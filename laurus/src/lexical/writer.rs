/// Trait for lexical index writers.
///
/// This trait defines the common interface that all lexical index writer implementations
/// must follow. The primary implementation is
/// [`InvertedIndexWriter`](crate::lexical::index::inverted::writer::InvertedIndexWriter).
///
/// # Write Semantics
///
/// All write operations (`add_document`, `upsert_document`, `delete_document`, etc.)
/// are **batched** in an in-memory buffer. Changes are only persisted to storage when
/// [`commit()`](Self::commit) is called. Use [`rollback()`](Self::rollback) to discard
/// all pending changes without persisting.
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// Implementations must be `Send + Sync`. However, all mutating methods require
/// `&mut self`, so external synchronization (e.g., via `Mutex`) is needed if
/// shared across threads.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use laurus::lexical::index::inverted::writer::{InvertedIndexWriter, InvertedIndexWriterConfig};
/// use laurus::lexical::writer::LexicalIndexWriter;
/// use laurus::storage::memory::{MemoryStorage, MemoryStorageConfig};
/// use laurus::storage::StorageConfig;
/// use std::sync::Arc;
///
/// let storage = Arc::new(MemoryStorage::new(MemoryStorageConfig::default()));
/// let config = InvertedIndexWriterConfig::default();
/// let mut writer = InvertedIndexWriter::new(storage, config).unwrap();
///
/// // Use LexicalIndexWriter trait methods
/// // writer.add_document(doc).unwrap();
/// // writer.commit().unwrap();
/// ```
