/// A high-level lexical search engine that provides both indexing and searching capabilities.
///
/// The `LexicalStore` wraps a `LexicalIndex` trait object and provides a simplified,
/// unified interface for all lexical search operations. It manages the complexity of
/// coordinating between readers and writers while maintaining efficiency through caching.
///
/// # Features
///
/// - **Writer caching**: The writer is created on-demand and cached until commit
/// - **Searcher invalidation**: Searchers are automatically invalidated after commits/optimizations
/// - **Index abstraction**: Works with any `LexicalIndex` implementation (Inverted, etc.)
/// - **Simplified workflow**: Handles the lifecycle of readers and writers automatically
///
/// # Caching Strategy
///
/// - **Writer**: Created on first write operation, cached until `commit()` is called
/// - **Searcher**: Cached on first search after invalidation; invalidated after `commit()` or `optimize()`.
///   Uses double-checked locking with `RwLockWriteGuard::downgrade()` so that only
///   searcher *creation* holds an exclusive lock; the actual search runs under a shared
///   read lock, allowing concurrent queries.
/// - This design ensures that you always read committed data while minimizing object creation
///
/// # Usage Example
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use laurus::lexical::core::document::Document;
