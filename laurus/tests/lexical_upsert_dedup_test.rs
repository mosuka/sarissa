//! Integration tests for `InvertedIndexWriter::remove_pending_document`
//! (Issue #570 — replace the per-upsert full-buffer scan with an O(1)
//! membership probe).
//!
//! `Engine::add_document` routes through `upsert_document(doc_id, ..)`, which
//! calls `remove_pending_document(doc_id)` before indexing. Previously that ran
//! `buffered_docs.retain(..)` — a full O(N) scan — on every call, even for
//! freshly assigned doc IDs that can never already be buffered, making an
//! `add × N` ingest O(N²). The fix keeps a `buffered_doc_ids` set in sync with
//! `buffered_docs` so the new-id case returns in O(1).
//!
//! These tests pin down both branches of the new code path and assert that the
//! externally observable behaviour is unchanged:
//! - new, never-seen doc IDs accumulate in the buffer (the O(1) early return);
//! - re-upserting an already-buffered doc ID still dedups in place and the
//!   in-memory index reflects only the latest version (the rebuild branch).
