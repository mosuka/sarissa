//! Regression tests for #872 — seed/incremental bulk-load recall parity.
//!
//! Appending a large batch onto a small HNSW base used to funnel every parallel
//! insert through the base's low-level entry point, fragmenting the graph:
//! reachability was still guaranteed (by the #868 connectivity repair), but the
//! appended nodes had far fewer/worse in-edges, so their search recall collapsed
//! to roughly half of a fresh full build of the same total size.
//!
//! The #872 fix has two regimes, and there is one test per regime:
//!   * base `< ef_construction` — the base is too shallow to navigate, so the
//!     append discards it and does a full rebuild (fresh quality). Covered by
//!     [`seed_then_bulk_load_recall_matches_fresh_build`] (base = 1).
//!   * base `>= ef_construction` — the incremental path is kept, but if the
//!     append promotes the entry point to a new top-level node, that node is
//!     inserted first and used as the build search start so inserts descend from
//!     the top layer instead of funneling through `old_ep`. Covered by
//!     [`incremental_append_recall_matches_fresh_build`] (base = 200).
//!
//! The gate is **self-recall@10**: query each node with its own vector and check
//! it appears in its own top-10. A well-built graph is ~1.0; a fragmented one is
//! much lower. Each test compares the appended nodes' self-recall against a fresh
//! full build of the same corpus — deterministic and independent of any fixed
//! absolute threshold (both builds see the identical vectors and query set).
