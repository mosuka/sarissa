//! Reproduction for #1017: whether a flushed-but-uncommitted segment is
//! visible to `search()` is currently accidental.
//!
//! `InvertedIndex::load_segments` discovers segments by listing storage for
//! `segment_*.meta`, consulting no commit marker, while `flush_segment` fires
//! automatically at `max_buffered_docs` and writes that `.meta` on the spot.
//! So whether a user sees uncommitted documents depends only on whether the
//! searcher cache happened to be cold — and the repository documents the
//! opposite in roughly twenty-five places ("documents become searchable only
//! after `commit()`").
//!
//! It is worse than early visibility. `segment_info_for` hard-codes
//! `has_deletions: false`, and deletions have been group-committed since
//! #875, so the flag and the `.delmap` only reach storage at commit.
//! `SegmentReader` short-circuits on that flag in `load_deletion_bitmap`,
//! `is_deleted` and `filter_deleted_soa` alike — meaning a searcher that can
//! see such a segment cannot filter its deletions or its superseded upsert
//! versions at all.
//!
//! These landed as `#[ignore]`d RED cases in #1020 and are un-ignored by the
//! fix, so they now stand as the regression gate for the contract.
