//! Integration tests for #875 — deferred (group-commit) deletion persistence.
//!
//! The delete-first path of an existing-id upsert used to persist deletion
//! state synchronously per delete: a `deletions.log` append plus a full
//! `.delmap` rewrite (each fsync'd on close) and a `.meta` JSON parse per
//! delete. #875 defers all of it to the writer's commit — mutations only
//! update in-memory bitmaps, and `flush_deletions` group-commits them once —
//! with crash safety provided by the engine WAL (the delete record precedes
//! every index mutation and replay is idempotent).
//!
//! These tests pin the externally observable contract:
//! - deletion state reaches storage exactly at commit (not per delete);
//! - within a commit, `.delmap` files land BEFORE the `metadata.json`
//!   `last_wal_seq` checkpoint (a mid-commit crash keeps the WAL delete
//!   records replayable) and no `deletions.log` is ever written;
//! - `optimize()` flushes buffered deletions before its force-merge, so they
//!   are never resurrected into the merged segment;
//! - `rollback()` keeps buffered deletions (they were never rollback-able);
//! - WAL recovery auto-commits, so replayed deletions are searchable on a
//!   freshly reopened engine without a manual commit.
