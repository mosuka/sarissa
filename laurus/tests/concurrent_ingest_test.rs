//! Correctness of ingestion driven from several threads at once (#546).
//!
//! Today the lexical writer sits behind a single mutex in `LexicalStore`,
//! so concurrent `put_document` / `add_document` calls are serialized and
//! these tests pass by construction. They exist because the DWPT work
//! removes that serialization: every invariant asserted here is one that
//! per-thread ingestion can break silently — a document indexed but not
//! findable, an update that leaves both versions live, counters that
//! drift from the documents actually present, or WAL state that replays
//! to something different from what was acknowledged.
//!
//! Each test therefore asserts an *observable* property, never an
//! implementation detail, so it keeps its meaning across the refactor.
