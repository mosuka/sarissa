//! Exposes [`laurus::CommitPolicy`] to JavaScript as the `CommitPolicy` value

/// Auto-commit policy — controls when the engine automatically runs the commit
/// ladder during ingestion.
///
/// By default the engine commits only when `commit()` is called explicitly; a
/// non-`manual` policy makes it commit automatically at an ingestion-driven
/// cadence (one full ladder per auto-commit). This is orthogonal to
/// `WalSyncPolicy`.
///
/// Construct one of the variants with the static factory methods and pass it to
/// `Index.create(path, schema, walSyncPolicy, commitPolicy)`.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```javascript
/// const { Index, Schema, CommitPolicy } = require("laurus-nodejs");
///
/// const schema = new Schema();
/// schema.addTextField("title");
///
/// // Auto-commit after every 1000 applied documents.
/// const index = await Index.create("./idx", schema, undefined, CommitPolicy.everyDocs(1000));
///
/// // Manual (the default if no policy is supplied): the caller drives commit().
/// const manual = CommitPolicy.manual();
/// ```
