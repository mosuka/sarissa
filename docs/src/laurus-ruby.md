# Ruby Binding Overview

The `laurus` gem provides Ruby bindings for the Laurus search engine. It is built as a native Rust extension using [Magnus](https://github.com/matsadler/magnus) and [rb_sys](https://github.com/oxidize-rb/rb-sys), giving Ruby programs direct access to Laurus's lexical, vector, and hybrid search capabilities with near-native performance.

## Features

- **Lexical Search** -- Full-text search powered by an inverted index with BM25 scoring
- **Vector Search** -- Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search using Flat, HNSW, or IVF indexes
- **Hybrid Search** -- Combine lexical and vector results with fusion algorithms (RRF, WeightedSum)
- **Rich Query DSL** -- Term, Phrase, Fuzzy, Wildcard, NumericRange, Geo, Boolean, Span queries
- **Text Analysis** -- Tokenizers, filters, stemmers, and synonym expansion
- **Flexible Storage** -- In-memory (ephemeral) or file-based (persistent) indexes
- **Idiomatic Ruby API** -- Clean, intuitive Ruby classes under the `Laurus::` namespace

## Architecture

        RbSearch["SearchRequest\n/ SearchResult"]
    end

    Ruby["Ruby application"] -->|"method calls"| RbIndex
    Ruby -->|"query objects"| RbQuery
    RbIndex -->|"Magnus FFI"| Engine["laurus::Engine\n(Rust)"]
    RbQuery -->|"Magnus FFI"| Engine
    Engine --> Storage["Storage\n(Memory / File)"]
```

The Ruby classes are thin wrappers around the Rust engine.
Each call crosses the Magnus FFI boundary once; the Rust engine
then executes the operation entirely in native code.

Although the Rust engine uses async I/O internally, all Ruby
methods are exposed as **synchronous** functions. Each method
calls `tokio::Runtime::block_on()` under the hood to bridge
async Rust to synchronous Ruby, releasing the GVL (Global VM
Lock) for the duration of that call (Issue #1103) so other Ruby
threads keep running while it's in flight -- a multi-threaded
server genuinely benefits from more worker threads, rather than
every call serializing on the GVL.

Because Ruby threads can now be concurrent writers for the first
time, the engine's existing concurrency caveats become reachable
from Ruby: `commit` is not serialized against concurrent
`put`/`add`/`delete` calls, and `CommitPolicy` auto-commit
guarantees hold for single-writer ingestion -- best-effort under
concurrent writers on a shared `Index`. Use explicit `commit`
calls, or a single ingest thread, when you need those guarantees
under concurrency.

Unlike the Python binding, `close` does not wait for any
in-flight call on another thread before returning: Magnus only
ever hands a plain `&self` to `#[magnus::wrap]` methods, so there
is no borrow-checker mechanism here to make `close` exclusive.
If another thread is still mid-call when `close` runs, that
call's own reference keeps the underlying engine (and its
storage lock) alive until the call returns.

## Quick Start

```ruby
require "laurus"

# Create an in-memory index
index = Laurus::Index.new

# Index documents
index.put_document("doc1", { "title" => "Introduction to Rust", "body" => "Systems programming language." })
index.put_document("doc2", { "title" => "Ruby for Web Development", "body" => "Web applications with Ruby." })
index.commit

# Search
results = index.search("title:rust", limit: 5)
results.each do |r|
  puts "[#{r.id}] score=#{format('%.4f', r.score)}  #{r.document['title']}"
end
```
