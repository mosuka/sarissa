# Vector Search

Vector search finds documents by semantic similarity. Instead of matching keywords, it compares the meaning of the query against document embeddings in vector space.

## Basic Usage

### Builder API

```rust
use laurus::SearchRequestBuilder;
use laurus::vector::search::searcher::VectorSearchQuery;
use laurus::vector::store::request::QueryPayload;
use laurus::data::DataValue;

let request = SearchRequestBuilder::new()
    .vector_query(
        VectorSearchQuery::Payloads(vec![
            QueryPayload {
                field: "embedding".to_string(),
                payload: DataValue::Text("systems programming language".to_string()),
                weight: 1.0,
            },
        ])
    )
    .limit(10)
    .build();

let results = engine.search(request).await?;
```

The `QueryPayload` stores raw data (text, bytes, etc.) that will be embedded at search time using the configured embedder.

### Query DSL

```rust
use laurus::vector::VectorQueryParser;

let parser = VectorQueryParser::new(embedder.clone())
    .with_default_field("embedding");

let request = parser.parse(r#"embedding:"systems programming""#).await?;
```

## VectorSearchQuery

The vector search query is specified as a `VectorSearchQuery` enum:

| Variant | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Payloads(Vec<QueryPayload>)` | Raw payloads (text, bytes, etc.) to be embedded at search time |
| `Vectors(Vec<QueryVector>)` | Pre-embedded query vectors ready for nearest-neighbor search |

### QueryPayload

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `field` | `String` | Target vector field name |
| `payload` | `DataValue` | The payload to embed (e.g., `DataValue::Text(...)`) |
| `weight` | `f32` | Score weight (default: 1.0) |

### QueryVector

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `vector` | `Vector` | Pre-computed dense vector embedding |
| `weight` | `f32` | Score weight (default: 1.0) |
| `fields` | `Option<Vec<String>>` | Optional field restriction |

### Examples

```rust
use laurus::vector::search::searcher::VectorSearchQuery;
use laurus::vector::store::request::{QueryPayload, QueryVector};
use laurus::vector::core::vector::Vector;
use laurus::data::DataValue;

// Text query (will be embedded at search time)
let query = VectorSearchQuery::Payloads(vec![
    QueryPayload {
        field: "text_vec".to_string(),
        payload: DataValue::Text("machine learning".to_string()),
        weight: 1.0,
    },
]);

// Pre-computed vector
let query = VectorSearchQuery::Vectors(vec![
    QueryVector {
        vector: Vector::from(vec![0.1, 0.2, 0.3]),
        weight: 1.0,
        fields: Some(vec!["embedding".to_string()]),
    },
]);
```

## Multi-Field Vector Search

You can search across multiple vector fields in a single request:

```rust
use laurus::vector::search::searcher::VectorSearchQuery;
use laurus::vector::store::request::QueryPayload;
use laurus::data::DataValue;

let query = VectorSearchQuery::Payloads(vec![
    QueryPayload {
        field: "text_vec".to_string(),
        payload: DataValue::Text("cute kitten".to_string()),
        weight: 1.0,
    },
    QueryPayload {
        field: "image_vec".to_string(),
        payload: DataValue::Text("fluffy cat".to_string()),
        weight: 1.0,
    },
]);
```

Each clause produces a vector that is searched against its respective field. Results are combined using the configured score mode.

### Score Modes

| Mode | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `WeightedSum` (default) | Sum of (similarity * weight) across all clauses |
| `MaxSim` | Maximum similarity score across clauses |
| `LateInteraction` | ColBERT-style late interaction scoring |

### Parallel Multi-Vector Execution

When a request carries multiple query vectors (e.g., ColBERT-style late
interaction, multi-vector MaxSim, ensemble rerankers), Laurus dispatches the
per-query similarity searches in parallel via [rayon][rayon-crate].

Behaviour:

- The parallelisation lives in
  `VectorIndexSearcher::search_batch`'s default implementation. On native
  builds (default `native` feature), once `queries.len()` reaches the
  searcher's `parallel_threshold` (default `4`, overridable per searcher),
  the per-query HNSW / Flat / IVF searches run on rayon's global thread
  pool. Below that threshold the serial loop wins because rayon's dispatch
  overhead (~1-2 µs) would otherwise dominate a single 50-200 µs query.
- On `wasm32` targets the serial path is always used because rayon is
  unavailable.
- Aggregation (the score-mode merge) and the final sort run serially after
  the per-query phase. Score ties are broken by ascending `doc_id` so the
  results are deterministic regardless of rayon's work-stealing schedule.

The external API surface (`VectorStore::search`, gRPC `Search`, REST
`POST /v1/search`, all language bindings) is unchanged; parallel execution
is purely an internal optimisation enabled by upgrading laurus. Speedups
scale with the host's available cores — on a 4-core / 8-thread laptop CPU
the parallel path reaches roughly 2× throughput at `B = 64` query vectors,
limited by physical core count and HyperThreading sharing.

### Parallel Brute-Force Scan

Flat and IVF indexes rank candidates with an exhaustive distance scan rather
than a graph walk. When one query's candidate count reaches an internal
threshold (`2048`), that scan is dispatched across [rayon][rayon-crate]'s
global thread pool; below it the serial loop wins because rayon's per-job
dispatch (~1-2 µs) would dominate a small scan.

This is orthogonal to the per-query parallelism above: a batch parallelises
across queries, and each large query further parallelises its own scan on the
same pool, with work-stealing bounding total parallelism to the pool size (no
OS-thread oversubscription). The distance kernel has no side effects, so
results are collected in arbitrary order and then sorted, keeping output
deterministic. On `wasm32` (no rayon) the scan is always serial.

Speedup scales with the host's physical cores and is largest for big Flat
indexes or a wide IVF `n_probe`; scans below the threshold are unaffected.

### Weights

Use the `^` boost syntax in DSL or `weight` in `QueryVector` to adjust how much each field contributes:

```text
text_vec:"cute kitten"^1.0 image_vec:"fluffy cat"^0.5
```

This means text similarity counts twice as much as image similarity.

### Field Routing

In a multi-field schema, each vector field has its own HNSW graph. By
default a query searches every vector field; restricting it to named
fields skips the others' graph work entirely.

Two routing inputs are honored, in priority order:

1. **Per-query** — `QueryVector.fields`. The DSL parser sets this from the
   field a clause names, so `image_vec:"fluffy cat"` only searches
   `image_vec`.
2. **Request-level** — `VectorSearchParams.fields`, a list of selectors:
   - `Exact("image_vec")` — match a field by exact name.
   - `Prefix("image_")` — match every field whose name starts with the
     prefix (resolved against the index's field names).

When neither is set, all fields are searched (the default). A query routed
to a field never returns documents that lack a vector in that field.

You can apply lexical filters to narrow the vector search results:

```rust
use laurus::SearchRequestBuilder;
use laurus::lexical::TermQuery;
use laurus::vector::search::searcher::VectorSearchQuery;
use laurus::vector::store::request::QueryPayload;
use laurus::data::DataValue;

// Vector search with a category filter
let request = SearchRequestBuilder::new()
    .vector_query(
        VectorSearchQuery::Payloads(vec![
            QueryPayload {
                field: "embedding".to_string(),
                payload: DataValue::Text("machine learning".to_string()),
                weight: 1.0,
            },
        ])
    )
    .filter_query(Box::new(TermQuery::new("category", "tutorial")))
    .limit(10)
    .build();

let results = engine.search(request).await?;
```

The filter query runs first on the lexical index to identify allowed document IDs, then the vector search is restricted to those IDs.

#### Filter-Aware HNSW Traversal

For HNSW fields the allowed-ID set is pushed into the graph search itself, not
just applied afterwards. During traversal the frontier still expands through
*every* neighbour — including non-matching ones — so the search can cross
non-matching regions of the graph, but only matching documents enter the
result set.

This matters for selective filters. A plain post-filter inspects the fixed
`ef_search` window of nearest neighbours and keeps whichever happen to match;
when matches are rare they can fall entirely outside that window, so the query
returns far fewer hits than exist — sometimes none, even though matching
documents are reachable. Filter-aware traversal keeps searching until it has
collected enough matches or hits an internal visit cap (a multiple of
`ef_search`) that bounds latency for very selective filters.

The unfiltered path is unchanged: with no filter the traversal behaves exactly
as before. Flat and IVF fields use the post-filter (their scan is exhaustive,
so no recall is lost).

### Filter with Numeric Range

```rust
use laurus::lexical::NumericRangeQuery;
use laurus::lexical::core::field::NumericType;

let request = SearchRequestBuilder::new()
    .vector_query(
        VectorSearchQuery::Payloads(vec![
            QueryPayload {
                field: "embedding".to_string(),
                payload: DataValue::Text("type systems".to_string()),
                weight: 1.0,
            },
        ])
    )
    .filter_query(Box::new(NumericRangeQuery::new(
        "year", NumericType::Integer,
        Some(2020.0), Some(2024.0), true, true
    )))
    .limit(10)
    .build();
```

## Distance Metrics

The distance metric is configured per field in the schema (see [Vector Indexing](../indexing/vector_indexing.md)):

| Metric | Description | Lower = More Similar |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cosine** | 1 - cosine similarity | Yes |
| **Euclidean** | L2 distance | Yes |
| **Manhattan** | L1 distance | Yes |
| **DotProduct** | Negative inner product | Yes |
| **Angular** | Angular distance | Yes |

    }

    Ok(())
}
