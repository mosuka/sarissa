/// Auto-commit policy for an [`crate::index::WasmIndex`].
///
/// Controls when the engine automatically runs the commit ladder during
/// ingestion:
///
/// - **Manual** (the default) — the caller drives every `commit()`.
/// - **Every-docs** — the engine commits after every `n` applied documents,
///   across the singular and batch ingest APIs (and every `n` documents within
///   a single batch).
///
/// This is orthogonal to `WalSyncPolicy`.
///
/// ```javascript
/// import { Index, Schema, CommitPolicy } from "laurus-wasm";
///
/// const schema = new Schema();
/// schema.addTextField("title");
///
/// // Auto-commit after every 1000 applied documents.
/// const index = await Index.create(schema, undefined, CommitPolicy.everyDocs(1000));
///
/// // Manual (the default if no policy is supplied).
/// const manual = CommitPolicy.manual();
/// ```
///
/// **wasm note:** unlike `WalSyncPolicy`'s `maxIntervalMs` timer, `everyDocs`
/// needs no background thread — it is checked inline during ingestion — so it
/// works fully under WebAssembly.
